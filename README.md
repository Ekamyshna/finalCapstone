# finalCapstone
This is the last Capstone Project that I created and also NLP project on garden path sentences.
In a file called nlp_1.pdf, I categorised which type of NLP application applies for
each of the use-cases. In a file called nlp_2 I wrote a brief summary about IBM innovative technology Watson Discovery using NLP.
